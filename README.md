# üß† NutriSense ‚Äì AI-Powered Personalized Diet Planner  

> **Smart. Adaptive. Sensor-Free Nutrition.**

---

## üåç Overview  

**NutriSense** is an innovative AI-based nutrition planning system that delivers **personalized diet recommendations** based on user health parameters such as age, gender, BMI, and activity level.  

Unlike traditional fitness or diet apps that rely on external wearables or static data, NutriSense uses a **sensor-free personalization approach** powered by **machine learning** to dynamically adjust nutrition goals and meal plans in real time.  

The system also includes a **responsive web dashboard** that enables users to visualize nutrition data, track meal habits, and receive adaptive recommendations powered by feedback learning.

SmartPlate ‚Äì AI-Driven Personalized Nutrition System

Overview

SmartPlate is a web-based system that analyzes user details (age, gender, height, weight, activity level, allergies, and health goals) to generate personalized diet recommendations using machine learning and nutrition datasets.

Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Chart.js
- Backend: Python (Flask), SQLite (SQLAlchemy)
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, pandas, NumPy

Key Features

- User registration and profile storage
- ML pipeline: preprocessing, clustering (KMeans), regression (XGBoost/LightGBM), and content-based recommendation via cosine similarity
- Meal plan generation and visualization of nutrient targets vs intake
- Feedback storage for iterative improvement

Quick Start

1. Create and activate a virtual environment
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the server: `python app.py`
4. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser

Notes

- The `ml/pipeline.py` file contains commented explanations of how clustering, regression, and content-based filtering are used.
- The dataset in `data/nutrition_sample.csv` is a minimal sample; replace with a comprehensive dataset (e.g., USDA) for better results.
